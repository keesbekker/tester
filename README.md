Scraping www.funda.nl

Please note:


- funda.nl seems to use the anti-scraping services of Distil Networks so when running this scraper you will have to manually pass a      Captcha every now and then
- this tool is structured in a such a way that it gently / ethically scrapes the pages it encounters (in other words, scraping data will take a while given the numerous "sleep" intervals embedded in the code)
- you will have to point the init_browser function to the local path of your webdriver (through the file_path variable)

The code takes as input search terms that would normally be entered on the Funda home page. It extracts 7 variables from each property listing, which in turn is appended to a dataframe and saved to a CSV file.
It further takes the number of pages you would like to extract as an input (nb - each pararius results page contains 15 listings).

This tool was written by means of [Python 3.5.1](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-351/), [Selenium 3.4.3](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/selenium) and [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/).

NB - inside the custom_page folder you will find a scraper that allows to scrape custom page ranges (instead of the base scraper that as a standard starts at page 1)

Example of the resulting dataframe:
